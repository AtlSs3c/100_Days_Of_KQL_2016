# Detecting Renamed AutoIt3 Execution (HijackLoader-aligned)

## Overview

This hunt detects **renamed or relocated AutoIt3 interpreter executions** from **user-writable and temporary paths**, a common technique used by **HijackLoader and similar loaders**. 
The detection is following Red Canary’s HijackLoader 
The goal is to identify **AutoIt runtime abuse**, not legitimate AutoIt installations or installers.

## Detection Logic Summary

This hunt identifies:

* Processes that **claim to be AutoIt** via embedded metadata
* Executing under a **non-canonical name**
* Running from **user-writable or temporary directories**
* **Excluding legitimate AutoIt install paths and installers**
